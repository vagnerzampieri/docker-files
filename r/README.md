## Overview ##

This repository contains Dockerfiles for different Docker containers of interest to R users. 

## Getting Started ##

To get started right away, ensure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and start a container with `docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-base` (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/) for the `docker run` command options). In this case we are starting the `r-base` container (the base package to build from) in an interactive mode, see below for details of the other containers currently available. To get started on the `rstudio` container or its derivative containers (eg. `hadleyverse` and `ropensci`) you need to open a port, see the [instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image). The [wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki) also contains further instructions and information on the project, including how to extend these images and contribute to development.

## Status ##

This is work in progress; please read our [instructions to contributors](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/How-to-contribute) and talk to @eddelbuettel and @cboettig about how to get involved.
